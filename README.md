The 1.21.2 will not work until WorldEdit for fabric 1.21.2 is released

A fabric Minecraft mod that adds some QOL features for creative mode. Also my first mod plz mercy. All of its features are only enabled in creative mode.

List of capabilities:

1. '/CreativeUtils FlightSpeedSet <multiplier>' - Sets your creative flight speed multiplied by the inputted value.
2. '/CreativeUtils FlightSpeedReset' - Resets your creative flight speed to the vanilla default.
3. '/CreativeUtils Onepunch On' - Makes you super stronk.
4. '/CreativeUtils Onepunch Off' - Makes you normal stronk.
5. '/CreativeUtils SetupNewWorld' - Disables the daylight and weather cycle, turns off firetick, sets the time to 1000(day), turns off natural mob spawns, and sets the difficulty to peaceful.
6. '/CreativeUtils SetAir' or '/air' - Make a selection with the WorldEdit selection tool and then run one of these commands to turn it to air.
7. Limits stack sizes to 1 to get rid of the uneven stack sizes (Can be bypassed by double clicking a hotbar hotkey while hovering over your desired item and does not apply to containers.)
