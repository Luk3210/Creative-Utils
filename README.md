A fabric mod that adds some QOL features for creative mode. Also my first mod plz mercy. All of its features are only enabled in creative mode.

List of capabilities:

'/CreativeUtils FlightSpeedSet <multiplier>' - Sets your creative flight speed multipied by the inputted value.
'/CreativeUtils FlightSpeedReset' - Resets your creative flight speed to the vanilla default.
'/CreativeUtils Onepunch On' - Makes you super stronk.
'/CreativeUtils Onepunch Off' - Makes you normal stronk.
'/CreativeUtils SetupNewWorld' - Disables the daylight and weather cycle, turns off firetick, and sets the time to 1000(day).
Limits stack sizes to 1 to get rid of the uneven stack sizes (Can be bypasses by double clicking a hotbar hotkey while hovering over your desired item and does not apply to containers.)
